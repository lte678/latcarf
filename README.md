[![Build](https://github.com/lte678/latcarf/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lte678/latcarf/actions/workflows/rust.yml)  
Latcarf is a ridiculously named fractal renderer.
It is a toy project to work with and develop skills with shaders, OpenGL, Rust, glium.rs and discover mathematical methods for _accurate_ and _aesthetic_ fractal depiction.

On a well-equipped machine (GTX 1070, 3600X @ 1080p), gpu-backed rendering achieves around 5000 fps.

## How to Run
`cargo run -- gpu` or `cargo run -- cpu`

Make sure the rust toolchain has been installed, with rustup for example.

## Interaction
Move the view around by clicking and dragging with LMB. Zoom using the scrollwheel.
